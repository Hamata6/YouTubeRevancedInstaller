# YouTube Revanced Installer
This is a script to help you build an APK file from the YouTube Revanced source files (CLI, Patches and Integrations).
The only thing you need is a supported version of the YouTube APK.
To know which version is supported by the patches, visit [https://revanced.app/patches?pkg=com.google.android.youtube](https://revanced.app/patches?pkg=com.google.android.youtube).
Note the version you see next to the bullseye emoji. Now download that YouTube apk version from internet (for example from APKMirror: https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube) and put it in the same folder as you run this script in.
