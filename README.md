# YouTube Revanced Installer
This is a script to help you build a patched APK file from the YouTube Revanced source files (CLI, Patches and Integrations).

## Prerequisites
- Java Runtime Environment 11 (Azul Zulu JRE or OpenJDK)

- A supported version of the YouTube APK.  
To know which version is supported by the patches, visit [https://revanced.app/patches?pkg=com.google.android.youtube](https://revanced.app/patches?pkg=com.google.android.youtube).
Note the version you see next to the bullseye emoji. Now download that YouTube apk version from internet (for example from APKMirror: https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube) and put it in the same folder as you run this script in.

- Optional: [Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools#downloads)
